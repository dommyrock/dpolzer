    <strong>How I Started Coding</strong>
    <br />
    I began coding nearly a decade ago, initially driven by a passion for creating games (using MonoGame/XNA
    and WinForms) as a hobby while studying civil engineering.
    <br />
    By 2017, I had reached my third year in civil engineering, with most of the courses completed. However,
    I realized that it wasn't something I wanted to pursue full-time. So, I decided to take an Associate's
    degree course at one of Croatia's top-tier computer science colleges.
    <br />
    Shortly after completing my courses, I landed my first Full Stack Engineer role at a small startup
    called Dotmetrics.

    <br /><br />

    <strong>Professional Experience</strong>
    <br />
    <p class="text-[#22c55e] mb-0">Short version</p>
    During my 8 years of professional experience, I've worked with various technologies and tools, including
    C#, Rust, SQL, JavaScript, PowerShell, Bash, Python, Go, and all the major cloud platforms. During
    those years I gained experience in distributed systems, multithreaded systems, large codebases, data
    processing, search systems, and high-traffic GraphQL servers.
    <br /><br />

    <p class="text-[#22c55e] mb-0">Longer version / Career Timeline</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Dotmetrics:</strong>
        I started working on .NET-based admin portals and a multithreaded backend aggregation engine
        that processed website user traffic metrics (from our embedded scripts) for EU & UK sites.
        <br />
        It was a great first job where a small team of principal engineers handled close to 1,000 EU
        sites. I had the opportunity to learn about write-heavy Cassandra clusters, BigQuery, SQL, key
        web metrics, and efficient web scrapers.

        <strong>Combis:</strong>
        After the startup, I transitioned to working on a B2B employee management platform integrated
        with MS Dynamics 365. My focus was on the backend, particularly the async scheduler, job queuing
        engine, and invoice generation engine.
        <br />
        I also developed early versions of Teams chatbots that allowed executives and project managers
        to trigger internal workflows through Teams chat controls, as well as the initial version of
        a distributed Black/White listing service for syncing potential B2B actors across the HT group
        companies.

        <strong>Bullhorn:</strong>
        I then moved on to work on a U.S. healthcare recruitment platform called Bullhorn. The specific
        product I was hired for had been in production for 20 years and had significant scale, serving
        large healthcare groups like HealthTrust, Maxim, and Beacon Hill.
        <br />
        I optimized systems for these high-traffic clients and was part of the core team that built and
        maintained the infrastructure code and GraphQL server that was processing requests from new mobile
        and portal aps. That server was processing about 100k req/min at peek times and was offloading
        most async workflows to multiple Hangfire instances. This work frequently required deep dives
        into EF ORM 'intermediate' code called expression trees and SQL execution schemas.(It was code
        generated by the .NET LINQ lib that was not always optimized for larger queries so it required
        writing custom expressions that hooked into ORM code generation of final SQL interpretation).

        <strong>Rust Experience:</strong>
        For the majority of previous professional projects we used .NET on the backend, but In 2022,
        I had my first opportunity to work with Rust in a production environment. I contributed to a
        Rust-based matching engine that enabled insurance companies to find B2B customers and offer tailored
        packages. Here, we used technologies such as Actix, SQLx, Grafana, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry,
        and Postgres. I really enjoyed Rust as a language (coming from previous C# project that had custom
        Maybe implementation, and a bit of F#)

    <strong>Open-Source Projects</strong>

    <br />

    Throughout my career, I’ve worked on my own projects, prototyping with new tech, cloud services,
    and languages. I’ve also contributed to several open-source projects, including:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Contributed to QrSync (a cross-device file-sharing CLI-based Rust app) by updating the
        entire dependency tree to the latest versions and resolving breaking changes, mostly related
        to HTTP middleware.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contributed to the TypeScript-to-Rust parser engine for the Windmill project, which offers a
        distributed cloud-hosted workflow engine.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <strong>Free Time</strong>
    <br />
    I enjoy chess puzzles, traveling, swimming, cycling and occasionally participating in hackathons or
    coding events.

    <strong>What's next</strong>
    <p>
      I hope more exciting challenges in the field of distributed systems, and possibly exploring
      projects in embedded systems as well, since I've become increasingly interested in those areas
      recently.
